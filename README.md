### ldap-tool
A simple Go script to manage OpenLDAP users

### Background
The script is based on a certain LDAP settings
- OpenLDAP
- the memberOf ldap plugin
- the SSH schema
- the SUDO schema
- password length and use of special charachter is in the config file
- the config file is toml formatted
- Runs on OSX or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 or newer)

### History
Using an UI interface such a phpLDAPadmin is not always possible, and so I decide 
to build this tools. Orignally it was written in **bash** using the ldap CLI's and then
in **Python**, but it was not always working on someone else's laptop do the specific command
(*bash*) or module (*Python*), so I decided to write it in Go

### Capabilities
The script is meant to be able to manage OpenLDAP user such:
- add (user)
- modify (user)
- delete (user)
- search (user and group)

## Usage
```
usage: ldap-tool [-h|--help] [-c|--configFile "<value>"] [-e|--environment
                 "<value>"] [-m|--mode
                 (create|modify|delete|search|group|admin|users|groups|admins)]
                 [-i|--info] [-v|--version]

                 Simple script to manage LDAP users

```

### Build or run the code the code
To build the code into a single binary as simple as
```
go build ldap-tools.go
```
If everything is well, then this will produce a binary called **ldap-tools** 

To run the code
```
